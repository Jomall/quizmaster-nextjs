# ðŸš€ Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub - EXACT COMMANDS

## ðŸ“‹ BEFORE YOU START
1. **Create GitHub account** at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one
2. **Create new repository** at [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
3. **Repository name**: `quiz-management-system`
4. **Keep it Public**
5. **Don't initialize with README** (you already have one)

## ðŸŽ¯ EXACT COMMANDS TO RUN

### **Step 1: Get Your GitHub Username**
- Your GitHub username is what appears after github.com/ in your profile URL
- Example: if your profile is `github.com/johndoe`, your username is `johndoe`

### **Step 2: Run These Exact Commands**

```bash
# Set the correct remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quiz-management-system.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## ðŸ”„ IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE USERNAME LATER
```bash
# If you made a mistake, run this to fix it:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/CORRECT_USERNAME/quiz-management-system.git
git push -u origin main
```

## âœ… VERIFICATION
After running these commands, you should see:
- **"Create a pull request"** button on your GitHub repository
- **All 96 files** uploaded to GitHub
- **Green "Code" button** showing your repository URL

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEP
Once your code is on GitHub, proceed to **Step 3: Deploy to Vercel** using the VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

## ðŸ“ž TROUBLESHOOTING
If you get any errors:
1. **Check your GitHub username** is spelled correctly
2. **Ensure repository exists** at github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quiz-management-system
3. **Verify you're logged in** to GitHub
